# Play it Safe: The Golden Rule

> **"When in doubt, aim for WCAG 2.2 Level AA."**

Accessibility laws (like the ADA in the US or EAA in Europe) are complex and evolving. However, almost all of them point to one technical standard as the safe harbor: the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**.

## Why WCAG 2.2 AA?

While laws differ, the technical solution is universal. WCAG 2.2 Level AA is the current global benchmark.

*   **United States**: The DOJ references WCAG (often 2.1, but 2.2 is the future-proof target) for ADA compliance.
*   **European Union**: The EN 301 549 standard mirrors WCAG criteria.
*   **Canada**: ACA and AODA point directly to WCAG.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

To minimize legal risk and maximize user access, follow this strategy:

1.  **Adopt WCAG 2.2 AA** as your internal definition of "Done".
2.  **Document your efforts**. Keep records of audits, automated test results, and remediation plans. Intent and progress matter in legal contexts.
3.  **Provide a Feedback Mechanism**. Ensure users can report accessibility barriers (e.g., an "Accessibility Statement" page with contact info). This often prevents lawsuits by allowing you to fix issues before they escalate.

## Key Takeaway

You don't need to be a lawyer to build compliant software. You just need to be a good engineer who follows the standard. **If you meet WCAG 2.2 AA, you are likely meeting the law.**
