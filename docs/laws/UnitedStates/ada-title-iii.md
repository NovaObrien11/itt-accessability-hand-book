# ADA Title III

**Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in "places of public accommodation."

## Does it apply to websites?
**Yes.** While the ADA (passed in 1990) does not explicitly mention the internet, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and numerous court rulings have affirmed that websites and mobile apps of businesses open to the public (retailers, banks, hotels, etc.) are considered places of public accommodation.

## The DOJ's Stance
In recent guidance and rulemaking, the DOJ has clarified that:
1.  **Web accessibility is required** under Title III.
2.  **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** is the technical standard the DOJ uses to assess compliance.

## Practical Implications
If your digital content is not accessible, you are at risk of:
*   **Lawsuits**: Thousands of ADA Title III lawsuits are filed annually against businesses with inaccessible websites.
*   **Demand Letters**: Many businesses receive legal demands to fix their sites before a lawsuit is filed.

## Recommendation
To comply with ADA Title III, businesses should ensure their websites and digital offerings meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** (or ideally **2.2 AA**) standards. This is the safest and most widely accepted measure of accessibility in the U.S. private sector.
