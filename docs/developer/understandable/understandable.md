# Understandable

Understandable is a core pillar of [POUR](pour.md). Your job: make sure users instantly get what they're seeing and doing.

- Don’t assume users know your acronyms or jargon.
- Define all technical terms on first use.
- If you use specialized language, add it a glossary of terms so everyone can find definitions fast.
- Example: Write "In Time Tec (ITT)" the first time, then just "ITT."

## Glossary of Terms

- **ITT** – In Time Tec
- **API** – Application Programming Interface
- **SSR** – Server Side Rendering
- (Add more as needed)
