**Lists**!SECTION
Lists are used to present information in a structured format, making it easier for users to read and understand. They can be used for various purposes, such as enumerating items, providing instructions, or summarizing key points.

## Guidelines for Using Lists
1. **Use Lists for Grouping Related Items**: Use lists to group related items together. This helps users quickly identify and understand the relationships between different pieces of information.
2. **Use Appropriate List Types**: Choose the appropriate list type based on the content:
  - `<ul>` for unordered lists (bulleted lists) when the order of items does not matter.
  - `<ol>` for ordered lists (numbered lists) when the order of items is important.
