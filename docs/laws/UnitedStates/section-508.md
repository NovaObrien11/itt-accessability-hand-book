# Section 508

## Summary
In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities. The law 29 U.S.C § 794d applies to all federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508, agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information comparable to the access available to others.

## AI Summary
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to make their websites, digital tools, and electronic documents accessible to people with disabilities. This includes not just internal tools but any public-facing digital content.

**Key points:**

- Who it applies to: All federal agencies, plus contractors/vendors providing digital content or services to them.

- Standard: As of the 2018 refresh, Section 508 officially adopts WCAG 2.0 AA as its technical standard for web content and software (with minor additional requirements).

**Implications:**

- All public-facing and most internal federal digital content must meet WCAG 2.0 AA.

- If you’re building products for or selling to the U.S. government, you’re required to comply.

- Enforcement: Compliance is required by law; failure can lead to lost contracts, federal audits, and legal issues.

*Bottom line:
If you work with the federal government, your digital content must meet WCAG 2.0 AA under Section 508. If you follow WCAG 2.1 AA, you’ll exceed current requirements and future-proof your work.*
