- Can't be invisible to all of their senses


### Operable

- User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- Interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform


### Understandable
- Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
- The content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding


### Robust

- Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
- As technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible
