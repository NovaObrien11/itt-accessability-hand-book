**Images of Text**  
Avoid using images of text unless absolutely necessary. If you must use them, ensure the image has sufficient contrast and always provide a text alternative. ([WCAG 2.1 §1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/images-of-text.html))

    - Why to avoid images of text:
      - They lose quality when resized.
      - They don’t adapt to user settings (like dark mode).
      - Screen readers can’t read them as text—only the image description.
      - They are difficult to translate.
    - Exceptions:
      - When the image is a logo or brand name.


**Formatting Text**
- Use clear, readable fonts. Avoid decorative or hard-to-read fonts. Stick to web-safe fonts such as Arial, Roboto, or Times New Roman.

- Don’t use full justification for body text. Left-aligned text is generally easier to read, especially for people with dyslexia or low vision.

- Use sufficient line spacing (1.5 is recommended) to improve readability.
- Provide adequate spacing: paragraphs should have enough space between them to avoid visual clutter.
- Use headings and subheadings to structure content. This helps users navigate and understand the hierarchy of information.
