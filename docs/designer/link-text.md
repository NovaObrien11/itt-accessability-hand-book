**Link Text**!SECTION
Link text is the clickable text in a hyperlink that directs users to another page or resource. It should be clear, descriptive, and provide context about the linked content.
- If you can't understand what the link does without reading the surrounding text, the link text is not descriptive enough.
- Avoid using generic phrases like "click here" or "read more" as link text.
- Use specific and meaningful text that describes the destination or action of the link.
- Ensure that link text is distinguishable from regular text, such as by using a different color or underlining.
- If a link opens in a new tab or window, indicate this in the link text (e.g., "opens in a new tab").
- Avoid using the same link text
