# Play it Safe

Adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA (or EN-301-549 in the European Union) standards ensures your digital content is accessible to a wide audience, including individuals with disabilities. By following these guidelines, you not only comply with legal requirements but also demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity and usability.

## Why WCAG 2.1 AA?

WCAG 2.1 AA is widely recognized as the benchmark for web accessibility. It provides clear criteria to make websites and applications perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users. Meeting these standards can help you avoid legal risks and improve user experience.

## EN-301-549
If you're operating in the European Union then you will have to comply with EN-301-549 over WCAG.

## Research local laws
Do your own research to make sure you are following the most up to date laws and regulations of applicable states, or country.

## Key Benefits

- **Legal Compliance**: Avoid lawsuits and penalties by adhering to accessibility laws.
- **Expanded Audience**: Reach more users, including those with disabilities.
- **Enhanced Usability**: Improve navigation and functionality for all users.

## How to Get Started

1. **Audit Your Content**: Use accessibility tools to identify areas for improvement.
2. **Implement Changes**: Update your design and code to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
3. **Test Regularly**: Continuously monitor and test your content for compliance.

Make accessibility a priority. You’ll stay compliant, avoid headaches, and—most importantly—build something everyone can actually use.
