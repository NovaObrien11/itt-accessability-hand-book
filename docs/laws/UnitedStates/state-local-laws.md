# State and Local Accessibility Laws

While federal laws like the ADA and Section 508 provide baseline requirements, **state and local governments** may have additional accessibility laws that apply to your projects.

## Why This Matters

State and local laws can:
- **Expand coverage** beyond federal requirements
- **Set different deadlines** or compliance timelines
- **Apply to smaller entities** not covered by federal law
- **Include additional requirements** beyond WCAG

## Common State-Level Laws

### California
- **Unruh Civil Rights Act**: Prohibits discrimination in business establishments, often interpreted to include websites
- **California Disabled Persons Act**: Additional state-level protections

### New York
- **New York State Human Rights Law**: Prohibits discrimination, including in digital services
- **New York City Human Rights Law**: Additional protections at the city level

### Other States
Many states have their own accessibility laws that may apply to digital services. Requirements vary by state.

## City-Level Ordinances

Major cities may have local accessibility ordinances:
- **San Francisco**: Local accessibility requirements for businesses
- **New York City**: City-level human rights laws
- **Chicago**: Local accessibility ordinances

## What to Do

1. **Research applicable laws** when starting a project in a new jurisdiction
2. **Check with legal counsel** for state and local requirements
3. **Document compliance efforts** for all applicable laws
4. **Remember**: Most state and local laws still reference **WCAG** as the technical standard

## The Good News

While state and local laws may have different scopes or deadlines, they typically reference the same technical standard: **WCAG 2.1 or 2.2 Level AA**. Meeting WCAG 2.2 AA will generally satisfy most state and local requirements.

## When to Check

Consider checking state and local laws when:
- Working with **state or local government** clients
- Operating in **regulated industries** (healthcare, finance, education)
- Serving customers in **jurisdictions with known strict laws** (California, New York)
- **Procurement requirements** specify state or local compliance

## Resources

- Consult with **legal counsel** familiar with accessibility law in your jurisdiction
- Check **state attorney general** websites for accessibility guidance
- Review **city government** websites for local ordinances
- Industry associations may provide guidance on state-specific requirements
