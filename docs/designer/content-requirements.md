# Content Requirements & User Needs

Accessible content must not only meet technical standards but also fulfill the actual needs of users. Understanding what client needs the content is fulfilling helps ensure your content is both accessible and useful.

## The Question: What Client Needs Is the Content Fulfilling?

Before creating or approving content, ask:
- **What problem does this solve?**
- **What user need does this meet?**
- **Is this the right content for this audience?**
- **Does this content help users achieve their goals?**

## Understanding User Needs

### 1. Identify the Goal

Every piece of content should have a clear purpose:
- **Informational**: Teaching users something
- **Transactional**: Helping users complete a task
- **Navigational**: Helping users find what they need
- **Persuasive**: Encouraging users to take action

### 2. Understand the Audience

Consider:
- **Who is the primary audience?**
- **What are their goals?**
- **What barriers might they face?**
- **What technology do they use?**
- **What's their experience level?**

### 3. Define Success

How will you know the content is successful?
- Users can complete their task
- Users understand the information
- Users can find what they need
- Users can access the content with their assistive technology

## Content That Fulfills User Needs

### Clear Purpose

**Bad:**
- Vague content that doesn't address a specific need
- Content that exists "just because"
- Duplicate content without clear purpose

**Good:**
- Content with a clear, stated purpose
- Content that directly addresses user goals
- Each piece of content serves a specific need

### User-Centered Language

**Bad:**
- "Our company offers solutions..."
- "Users can access features..."
- Technical jargon without explanation

**Good:**
- "You can track your order here..."
- "We'll help you complete your application..."
- Plain language that users understand

### Actionable Content

**Bad:**
- "Information is available"
- "Features can be accessed"
- Vague instructions

**Good:**
- "Click here to view your order status"
- "Complete these three steps to apply"
- Clear, actionable instructions

## Accessibility and User Needs

Accessible content that doesn't meet user needs is still a failure. Consider:

### Can Users Access It?

- ✅ Meets WCAG 2.2 AA standards
- ✅ Works with assistive technologies
- ✅ Keyboard accessible
- ✅ Proper contrast and readability

### Can Users Understand It?

- ✅ Plain language
- ✅ Clear structure
- ✅ Logical flow
- ✅ Appropriate for audience

### Can Users Use It?

- ✅ Helps users achieve their goals
- ✅ Provides value
- ✅ Meets the stated need
- ✅ Actionable and useful

## Content Audit Questions

For each piece of content, ask:

1. **Purpose**: What need does this fulfill?
2. **Audience**: Who needs this content?
3. **Accessibility**: Can all users access it?
4. **Clarity**: Is it clear and understandable?
5. **Actionability**: Does it help users take action?
6. **Relevance**: Is it still needed?
7. **Completeness**: Does it fully address the need?

## Examples

### Example 1: Error Message

**User Need:** Understand what went wrong and how to fix it

**Bad Content:**
```
Error: Validation failed
```

**Good Content:**
```
Email address is invalid

Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@example.com)
```

**Why it's better:**
- Explains what's wrong
- Provides guidance on how to fix it
- Uses plain language
- Accessible to screen readers

### Example 2: Navigation Link

**User Need:** Find and access account settings

**Bad Content:**
```
<a href="/settings">Click here</a>
```

**Good Content:**
```
<a href="/settings">Account Settings</a>
```

**Why it's better:**
- Describes the destination
- Makes sense out of context
- Screen reader users can navigate efficiently
- Fulfills the need to find settings

### Example 3: Form Instructions

**User Need:** Complete the form correctly

**Bad Content:**
```
Complete all required fields
```

**Good Content:**
```
Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*)

Email: Enter your email address (e.g., name@example.com)
Phone: Enter your phone number in format (123) 456-7890
```

**Why it's better:**
- Explains what "required" means
- Provides format examples
- Reduces errors
- Helps users complete the task
