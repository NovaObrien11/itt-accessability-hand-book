# How to use
- This handbook mirrors WCAG 2.1 AA and EN 301-549 but isn’t a substitute for them. 
- Use it as ITT’s guide for improving user experience and staying compliant—not as a replacement for official standards.

## Perceivable  
- Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- Can't be invisible to all of their senses


## Operable

- User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- Interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform


## Understandable
- Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
- The content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding


## Robust

- Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
- As technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible
