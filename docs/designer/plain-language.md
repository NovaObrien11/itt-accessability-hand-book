# Plain Language

Use language that is easy to read and understand. Avoid jargon, technical terms, and complex sentence structures. Aim for clarity and simplicity to ensure that your content is accessible to a wide audience.

## Why Plain Language Matters

Clear, simple language benefits everyone, but it's especially important for:
- Users with cognitive disabilities
- People with dyslexia
- Non-native speakers
- Users with low literacy levels
- Anyone reading in a hurry or under stress

## Best Practices

- **Short sentences**: Aim for 15-20 words per sentence
- **Simple words**: Use common words instead of complex ones
- **Active voice**: "Click the button" not "The button should be clicked"
- **Personal pronouns**: Use "you," "we," and "I" to make content more engaging
- **Avoid jargon**: Explain technical terms when necessary
- **Use headings**: Break up long blocks of text
- **Bullet points**: Use lists for key information

## Active Voice

### Why Active Voice Matters

Active voice is clearer, more direct, and easier to understand than passive voice. This is especially important for:
- Users with cognitive disabilities
- People with dyslexia
- Non-native speakers
- Anyone reading quickly

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Active voice** puts the subject (the doer) first:
- "You can click the button"
- "We process your order"
- "The system saves your changes"

**Passive voice** puts the object (what's being done) first:
- "The button can be clicked"
- "Your order is processed"
- "Your changes are saved by the system"

### Examples

:::danger Passive Voice (Harder to Understand)
- "The form must be completed by users"
- "Errors are displayed when validation fails"
- "The account can be created by clicking the button"
:::

:::tip Active Voice (Clearer)
- "You must complete the form"
- "We display errors when validation fails"
- "You can create an account by clicking the button"
:::

### When to Use Active Voice

Use active voice for:
- **Instructions**: "Click the button" not "The button should be clicked"
- **Error messages**: "You entered an invalid email" not "An invalid email was entered"
- **Success messages**: "We saved your changes" not "Your changes were saved"
- **Help text**: "You can find your order number in the email" not "The order number can be found in the email"

## Personal Pronouns

### Why Personal Pronouns Help

Using "you," "we," and "I" makes content:
- **More engaging**: Feels like a conversation, not a manual
- **Clearer**: Directly addresses the user
- **Easier to follow**: Reduces cognitive load
- **More accessible**: Simpler sentence structure

### Using "You" (Addressing the User)

**Bad:**
- "Users must complete the form"
- "The account can be accessed"
- "Settings may be changed"

**Good:**
- "You must complete the form"
- "You can access your account"
- "You can change your settings"

### Using "We" (Speaking for Your Organization)

**Bad:**
- "The company processes orders within 24 hours"
- "Support is available Monday through Friday"

**Good:**
- "We process orders within 24 hours"
- "We're available Monday through Friday"

### Using "I" (When Appropriate)

For user-facing content, "I" is less common but can be used in:
- Confirmation messages: "I understand" checkbox
- User preferences: "I want to receive emails"
- Personalization: "My account," "My orders"

### Examples

:::danger Impersonal (Less Engaging)
- "Users should verify their email address"
- "The system will send a confirmation"
- "Account settings can be updated in the profile section"
:::

:::tip Personal (More Engaging)
- "You should verify your email address"
- "We'll send you a confirmation"
- "You can update your account settings in your profile"
:::

### Finding the Right Balance

- **Use "you"** for instructions and user actions
- **Use "we"** for company actions and support
- **Avoid "users"** or "customers" when "you" works better
- **Be consistent** throughout your interface

## Readability Tools

### Hemingway Editor

The **[Hemingway Editor](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/)** is a free web-based tool that helps improve readability by:

- Highlighting hard-to-read sentences
- Identifying passive voice
- Flagging complex words
- Suggesting simpler alternatives
- Providing a readability grade

**How to use:**
1. Paste your content into the editor
2. Review highlighted issues (yellow = hard to read, red = very hard)
3. Simplify sentences and replace complex words
4. Aim for a readability grade of 6-8 (6th-8th grade reading level)

**Target**: Grade 6-8 reading level for general audiences. Grade 4-6 for critical information.

### Other Readability Tools

- **Microsoft Word**: Built-in readability statistics (Flesch-Kincaid)
- **Grammarly**: Includes readability suggestions
- **Readable.io**: Comprehensive readability analysis

## WCAG Connection

While **WCAG 3.1.5 Reading Level (Level AAA)** requires content at lower secondary education level (approximately grade 6-8), using plain language is a best practice that benefits all users, even if you're targeting Level AA.
