## Basic Accessibility Checklist for Developers

1. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose (e.g., `<button>` for buttons, `<header>` for headers).
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
3. **ARIA Roles**: Use ARIA roles sparingly and only when necessary to enhance accessibility.
4. **Color Contrast**: Verify sufficient contrast between text and background colors.
5. **Alt Text**: Provide meaningful alt text for images.
6. **Focus Management**: Ensure focus is managed correctly, especially for dynamic content.
7. **Error Handling**: Make error messages clear and accessible.
8. **Responsive Design**: Ensure content adapts well to different screen sizes and orientations.
9. **Testing**: Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
