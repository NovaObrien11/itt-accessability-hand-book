# European Union

The European Union has established some of the world's most comprehensive digital accessibility legislation. The primary standard is **EN 301 549**, which aligns closely with WCAG.

## The European Accessibility Act (EAA)

**Status**: Adopted in 2019, Enforcement begins **June 28, 2025**.

The EAA (Directive 2019/882) is a landmark law that harmonizes accessibility requirements for products and services across the EU. Unlike previous directives that applied mainly to the public sector, the EAA applies to the **private sector**.

### Who is affected?
Any business selling products or services in the EU, including:
*   E-commerce websites and apps
*   Banking and financial services
*   E-books and e-readers
*   ATMs and ticketing machines
*   Operating systems and smartphones

### What is required?
Digital products must be "perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust." In practice, this means compliance with the harmonized European standard **EN 301 549**.

## EN 301 549

**What is it?**
EN 301 549 is the European standard for digital accessibility.

**Relationship to WCAG:**
For web and mobile content, EN 301 549 directly references **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**. If you meet WCAG 2.1 AA, you generally meet the web requirements of EN 301 549.

> **Note:** EN 301 549 includes additional requirements beyond WCAG for things like biometrics and real-time text, but for standard web development, WCAG is the core.
