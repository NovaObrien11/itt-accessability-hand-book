**Decorative images** are images that do not add any meaningful content or information to the page. They are purely decorative and do not convey any message or context that is necessary for understanding the content.

When using decorative images, it is important to ensure that they do not distract from the main content of the page. Decorative images should be used sparingly and only when they enhance the overall design without detracting from the user experience.

**Alternative text** (alt text) is a description of an image that is read by screen readers and displayed in place of the image if it fails to load. Alt text is essential for making images accessible to users with visual impairments.

When writing alt text, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Be descriptive**: Provide a clear and concise description of the image content.
2. **Context matters**: Include information about the image's purpose and how it relates to the surrounding content.
3. **Keep it short**: Aim for a brief description (typically 1-2 sentences) that conveys the essential information.
4. **Avoid redundancy**: Do not repeat information that is already conveyed in the surrounding text.

By following these guidelines, you can create effective alt text that improves accessibility for all users.
