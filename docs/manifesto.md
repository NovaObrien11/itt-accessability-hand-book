# The ITT Accessibility Manifesto

> "Accessibility is not a feature, it is a human right."

## Our Mission

At In Time Tec, we believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or impairments. This handbook serves as our **living operational standard** for building inclusive software.

We are committed to ensuring our digital products meet the **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** standards. This is not just about compliance; it's about empathy, quality, and delivering a superior user experience to all our users.

## Who is Responsible?

Accessibility is a shared responsibility across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC):

*   **Designers**: Define the experience, contrast, and structure before a single line of code is written.
*   **Developers**: Implement semantic code, manage focus, and ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
*   **QA/SDETs**: Verify compliance through automated and manual testing.
*   **Product Owners**: Prioritize accessibility requirements as part of the "Definition of Done".

## How to Use This Handbook

This handbook is organized by role to provide you with the specific tools and checklists you need:

*   **[Designers](/docs/designer-checklist)**: Start here to learn about annotations, color contrast, and layout.
*   **[Developers](/docs/developer-checklist)**: Find code snippets, ARIA best practices, and integration guides.
*   **[QA/SDETs](/docs/qa/testing-tools)**: Learn how to audit applications using automated tools and screen readers.

## The Standard

We target **[WCAG 2.2 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)**.

This means:
1.  **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2.  **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3.  **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
4.  **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
