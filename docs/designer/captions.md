Captions, Transcripts, and Audio Descriptions

- Audio descriptions help capture unspoken information in videos, such as visual elements, actions, and context that are not conveyed through audio alone.
- Transcripts provide a text version of audio content, making it accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as those who prefer reading over listening.
- Captions are essential for videos, as they provide a text representation of spoken dialogue and important non-verbal audio cues, such as sound effects and music, ensuring that users who are deaf or hard of hearing can fully understand the content.
