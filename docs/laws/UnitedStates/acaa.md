# Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA)

The **Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA)** is a U.S. federal law enacted in 1986 that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in air travel. While primarily focused on physical accessibility in airports and aircraft, ACAA also includes requirements for digital services provided by airlines.

## Who Must Comply?

- **U.S. and foreign airlines** operating flights to, from, or within the United States
- **Airports** and airport facilities
- **Third-party vendors** providing digital services for airlines (websites, mobile apps, kiosks)

## Digital Accessibility Requirements

While ACAA covers many physical accessibility requirements (aircraft features, boarding assistance, service animals), it also applies to digital services:

- **Airline websites** for booking, check-in, and flight management
- **Mobile applications** for airline services
- **Self-service kiosks** at airports
- **Digital boarding passes** and travel documents

## The Standard: WCAG

For digital services, ACAA compliance typically requires adherence to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards, similar to other U.S. accessibility laws. Airlines must ensure their websites and mobile applications are accessible to passengers with disabilities.

## Key Digital Requirements

- **Booking systems** must be accessible via screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Check-in kiosks** must be accessible to users with disabilities
- **Mobile apps** must support assistive technologies
- **Alternative formats** must be available for digital content when needed

## When This Applies to ITT

If ITT is developing or maintaining:
- Airline websites or booking systems
- Airport kiosk software
- Travel-related mobile applications
- Digital services for airlines or travel companies

Then ACAA compliance is required, and the standard approach is to meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** (or 2.2 AA for future-proofing).

## Relationship to Other Laws

ACAA is industry-specific but aligns with broader accessibility requirements:
- **ADA Title III** may also apply to airline websites (public accommodations)
- **Section 508** applies if working with government travel services
- All point to **WCAG** as the technical standard
