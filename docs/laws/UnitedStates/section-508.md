# Section 508

**Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973** is a federal law that requires federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities.

## Who must comply?
1.  **Federal Agencies**: All U.S. federal agencies and departments.
2.  **Federal Contractors**: Any company selling digital products or services to the federal government.
3.  **Federally Funded Programs**: Organizations receiving federal funding (often extends to higher education).

## The Standard: WCAG 2.0 AA
In its 2018 refresh, Section 508 officially incorporated the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA** as the federal standard.

> **Note:** While the *legal* requirement is currently WCAG 2.0 AA, modern best practice (and the requirement for ADA Title II) is **WCAG 2.1 AA** or **2.2 AA**. We highly recommend aiming for the newer standards to ensure better usability and future-proofing.

## VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)
If you sell software to the government, you will likely be asked for a **VPAT**.
*   A VPAT is a document that explains how your product conforms to Section 508 standards.
*   It is used by government buyers to assess the accessibility of your product before purchase.
*   **Tip**: Be honest in your VPAT. Inaccurate claims can lead to contract termination.
