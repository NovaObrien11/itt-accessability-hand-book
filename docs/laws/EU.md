# European Union
The European Union’s gold standard for digital accessibility is EN-301-549, which is legally enforced under the European Accessibility Act (EAA).

## Laws
[The European Accessibility Act (EAA)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882)
Adopted in 2019, the EAA sets minimum accessibility requirements for a wide range of digital products and services (think: websites, mobile apps, ATMs, e-commerce, and more) sold in the EU. Enforcement kicks in June 28, 2025. If you do business in the EU, you can’t ignore this—non-compliance can mean legal trouble and lost customers.
