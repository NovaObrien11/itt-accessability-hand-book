# Accessibility Standards & Guidelines

## WCAG-UX

**What it is:** Not an official standard

**Purpose:** Sometimes used informally to mean "UX best practices aligned with WCAG"

**Details:** WCAG-UX is an informal term used in the accessibility community to refer to user experience practices that align with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) principles. While WCAG provides technical standards and success criteria, WCAG-UX emphasizes the user experience aspects of accessibility—how accessible design feels and works for users with disabilities. This term helps bridge the gap between technical compliance and user-centered design, encouraging designers and developers to think beyond checkbox compliance to consider the actual experience of users with disabilities.

## ATAG

**What it is:** Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines

**Purpose:** Ensures tools used to create content are accessible and help produce accessible content

**Details:** ATAG (Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines) is a W3C standard that provides guidelines for making authoring tools themselves accessible. This includes content management systems, WYSIWYG editors, code editors, and other tools used to create web content. ATAG has two main parts: Part A focuses on making the authoring tool interface accessible to authors with disabilities, while Part B ensures the tool helps authors create accessible content through features like accessibility checking, prompts for alt text, and accessible template generation. Compliance with ATAG helps ensure that people with disabilities can contribute to web content creation, and that tools guide all authors toward creating accessible output.

## WAI-ARIA

**What it is:** Accessible Rich Internet Applications

**Purpose:** Adds semantics (roles, states, properties) to dynamic web content

**Details:** WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a technical specification that provides a way to make dynamic web content and applications more accessible to people using assistive technologies, particularly screen readers. ARIA doesn't change the visual appearance or behavior of content, but adds semantic meaning through roles, states, and properties that assistive technologies can understand. Common use cases include custom interactive components (like custom dropdowns or tabs), live regions for dynamic content updates, and complex widgets that don't have native HTML equivalents. ARIA should be used as a supplement to semantic HTML—when HTML5 elements are available, they should be used first. ARIA is essential for modern, JavaScript-heavy web applications where standard HTML semantics aren't sufficient.

## WCAG-EM

**What it is:** Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology

**Purpose:** Provides a structured approach to auditing large or complex websites against WCAG (sample selection, scoring, reporting, etc.)

**Details:** WCAG-EM (Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology) is a W3C methodology that provides a standardized process for evaluating website accessibility against WCAG. It offers a structured approach for conducting comprehensive accessibility audits, particularly for large or complex websites where testing every page isn't feasible. The methodology includes guidance on defining the evaluation scope, selecting representative samples of pages and components, determining conformance levels, documenting findings, and reporting results. WCAG-EM helps ensure that accessibility evaluations are thorough, consistent, and defensible, making it valuable for formal accessibility audits, compliance reporting, and ongoing accessibility monitoring programs. It's particularly useful for organizations that need to demonstrate WCAG conformance for legal or procurement purposes.
