Headings are used to structure your document and provide a hierarchy of information. They help readers navigate through the content and understand the relationships between different sections.

## Guidelines for Using Headings
1. **Use Headings to Organize Content**: Use headings to break up your content into logical sections. This makes it easier for users to scan and find the information they need.
2. **Use Headings in Hierarchical Order**: Start with the main heading (`<h1>`) and use subsequent headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`,) to create a hierarchy. **Best practice:** Do not skip heading levels (e.g., do not go from `<h1>` to `<h3>` without an `<h2>`). While not explicitly required by WCAG, maintaining sequential heading levels improves navigation for screen reader users and creates a clearer document structure.
3. **Use Descriptive Headings**: Make sure your headings accurately describe the content of the section. This helps users understand what to expect and improves accessibility for screen reader users.
4. **Limit the Number of Headings**: Avoid using too many headings in a single document. This can overwhelm users and make it difficult to navigate. Aim for a clear structure with a few main sections and subsections.
5. **Use Headings for Accessibility**: Screen readers use headings to navigate through content. Properly structured headings make it easier for users with disabilities to understand the layout and flow of the document.
6. **Avoid Using Headings for Styling**: Do not use headings solely for visual styling. Use CSS to style text instead. Headings should convey meaning and structure, not just appearance.
7. **Use Headings Consistently**: Maintain a consistent heading structure throughout your document. This helps users understand the organization and flow of information.



**Page Title**!SECTION
The page title is the main heading of your document and should be clear, concise, and descriptive. It should accurately reflect the content of the page and help users understand what to expect.
- Use a single `<h1>` tag for the main title of the page.
- The page title will be the first thing a screen reader reads when navigating to the page, so it should be meaningful and informative.
- Avoid using the same title for multiple pages, as this can confuse users and search engines.
    - If you do have repeated information, place it at the end of the title, e.g., "About Us - Company Name".
