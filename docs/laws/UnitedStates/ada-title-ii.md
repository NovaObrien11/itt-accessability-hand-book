# ADA Title ii
- RIN 1190–AA46 Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in State and Local Government Services
## Summary
This final rule revises the regulation of the Department of Justice (Department) that implements title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), relating to nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in State and local government services. The Department is issuing this final rule in order to adopt enforceable accessibility standards under the ADA that are consistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board), and to update or amend certain provisions of the title II regulation so that they comport with the Department’s legal and practical experiences in enforcing the ADA since 1991. Concurrently with the publication of this final rule for title II, the Department is publishing a final rule amending its ADA title III regulation, which covers nondiscrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations and in commercial facilities.
## AI Summary
As of April 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice finalized a rule under Title II of the ADA mandating that all state and local government websites and mobile apps comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. This ensures digital content is accessible to individuals with disabilities, covering areas like navigation, multimedia, and document accessibility. Compliance deadlines are set for April 2026 for larger entities and April 2027 for smaller ones. Third-party vendors providing digital services to these governments are also required to meet these standards. While exceptions exist for certain archived content and third-party materials beyond government control, the overarching goal is to guarantee equitable digital access to public services for all citizens.
